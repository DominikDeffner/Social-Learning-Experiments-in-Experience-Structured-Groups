# Social-Learning-Experiments-in-Experience-Structured-Groups

Accompanying repo for Preregistration "Social Learning in Experienced-structured Groups" on the 
Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/a5bkg/). 

- "Deffner&McElreath_Prereg" contains the preregistration document

- "Experiment_Sim.r" lets you simulate microsociety social learning experiment with migration.

- "CombineConfExpInfo.r" computes and plots choice probabilities according to different ways to combine conformity and experience info

- "DataPrepAndModels.r" prepares data and runs stan models

- "PlottingScripts.r" contains code to compute and plot individual-level model predictions for model 4, 5 and 6

- ewa_model1.stan : Individual learning only

- ewa_model2.stan : Simplest social learning model

- ewa_model3.stan : Add conformity and experience bias

- ewa_model4.stan : Full Gaussian process model

- ewa_model5.stan : Full functional (logistic, exponential, Gaussian) model

- ewa_model6.stan : Full monotonic effects model
